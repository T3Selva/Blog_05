            <p>A reddit post by u/ibreakphotos claims that the samsung space zoom capturing the moon is fake by taking a photograph of the moon through a computer screen and appeared more crip then the actual image. The computer image lacked details which the Samsung S23 Ultra covered and to the reddit user concluded that the Samsung space zoom technology capturing the moon makes the moon appear fake. the article addresses that photography is changing overtime and the overall perception of a "real photo" changes as well. In comlusion, there is no such thing as a "real photo" and the terminology fake does not define the samsung space zoom technology.</p>
